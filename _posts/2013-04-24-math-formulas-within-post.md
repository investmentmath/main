*(Warning: this post was written
when Wordpress was used to generate the blog. Quicklatex is no longer used. MathJax remains
the tool used for math rendering). This post gives a few recipes to
integrate mathematical formulas in html pages. This site uses MathJax, a
javascript implementation of Latex.*

Introduction
============

InvestmentMath uses two Wordpress plugins to display formulas:
[**MathJax**](http://www.mathjax.org/ "MathJax")and
[**QuickLaTex**](http://www.quicklatex.com/ "QuickLatex").

We'll first introduce MathJax.

MathJax : Adding LaTex formulas within posts
============================================

MathJax is an open-source (everyone can edit or read the source code)
rendering engine for math formulas written in $\LaTeX$. It uses
Javascript, so the rendering is done on the client-side. It preserves
the server resources; however, slow clients will have significant
loading times. According to its website, it uses plain ol' CSS and web
fonts, which means that its rendering is extremely clean and that it's
scalable. In addition, people with vision disabilities can zoom up to
400% using the MathJax menu which is obtained by right-clicking on any
formula.

MathJax is amazingly powerful, and what's more, the developers claim
compatibility with all modern browsers. You can use it as a plugin with
Drupal, Joomla!, MediaWiki, Wordpress and much more ... It's also used
within the Ipython notebooks, a subject we will address in another post.

Now, here is an example showcasing the power of MathJax. Behold !

$$\log(P_{N})-\log(P_{0})=\sum_{k=0}^{K^{\delta}-1}
\log(P_{t^{\delta}_{k+1}})-\log(P_{t^{\delta}_{k}})=
\sum_{k=0}^{K^{\delta}-1}
\log(P_{t^{\delta}_{k+1}}/P_{t^{\delta}_{k}})$$

You can right-click on this formula to discover the flexibility of
MathJax and, in particular, to access the following code:

~~~~ {.theme:github .font:inconsolata .lang:default .decode:true}
$$\log(P_{N})-\log(P_{0})=\sum_{k=0}^{K^{\delta}-1} \log(P_{t^{\delta}_{k+1}})-\log(P_{t^{\delta}_{k}})= \sum_{k=0}^{K^{\delta}-1} \log(P_{t^{\delta}_{k+1}}/P_{t^{\delta}_{k}})$$

QuickLaTex: inserting LaTex graphics made with TikZ
===================================================

As you might have seen, some posts here use graphics generated in
$\LaTeX$ with TikZ. But, sadly, MathJax doesn't support TikZ. We use
QuickLaTex for that purpose. QuickLatex generates an image, which is
then inserted in the web page. It also takes plain $\LaTeX$ code like
MathJax, but we only use it for its abilty to render TikZ graphics. It
is nowhere near as powerful as MathJax. Let's try an example, the very
neat diagram from the Portfolio Returns post :

![](/assets/media/portfolioreturn.png)

Here is the code :

~~~~ {.theme:github .font:inconsolata .lang:default .decode:true}
[latex]
\begin{tikzpicture}[
    scale=5,
    axis/.style={very thick, ->, >=stealth'},
    important line/.style={thick},
    dashed line/.style={dashed, thin},
    pile/.style={thick, ->, >=stealth', shorten <=2pt, shorten
    >=2pt},
    every node/.style={color=black}
    ]
% Include tikz into local preamble
[+preamble]
     \usepackage{tikz}
     \usetikzlibrary{arrows}
[/preamble]
    \node at (-0.6,1.1) [] {\tiny .};
    \node at (2.2,-0.8) [] {\tiny .};
    \node at (.5,.9) [below] {\em 'Cadlag' prices and 'caglad weights' };
    \draw[axis] (-0.2,-.6)  -- (1.5,-.6) node(xline)[right]
        {$Time$}
    \draw[dashed line] (-0.4,0)  -- (2,0);
    \draw[important line] (0,0.2) -- (.5,.2) coordinate (A);
    \draw[important line] (.5,.5) coordinate (B) -- (1.0,.5) node[right, text width=1em] {$\omega_{.}$};
    \draw[dashed line] (.5,.1)  -- (.5,.5);
    \draw[dashed line] (.5,-.6)  coordinate (C) -- (.5,-.1);
     \fill[red] (A) circle (.4pt) node[right] {$\omega_{t}(=\omega_{t-})$};
     \node at (B)  [above] {$\omega_{t+}$};
     \node at (C) [below] {$t$};
     \draw[important line] (0,-.4) -- (.5,.-.4) coordinate (D) ;
     \draw[important line] (.5,-.2) coordinate (E) -- (1.0,-.2) node[right, text width=1em] {$P_{.}$};
     \fill[red] (E) circle (.4pt) node[left] {$(P_{t+}=)P_{t}$};
     \node at (D)  [right] {$P_{t-}$};
\end{tikzpicture}
[/latex]

Tikz code might look complicated but actually is not. It takes about an
hour for a $\LaTeX$ user to understand the logic. In addition, Tikz
code can be directly generated through Geogebra and its friendly GUI!
